<h1>Evan Weinman</h1>
<h2>Project #1</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/evanweinman.html</li>
    <li>The first project we worked on was a personal website for ourselves. This was pre-bootstrap learning and the goal was to go for a sleak minimalistic design.</li>
   </ul>

<h2>Project #2</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/eCommerce/ecommerce.html</li>
    <li>The second project was a front-end prototype of an E-commerce website. I introduce some bootstrap to give the website a very modern look this includes a navbar, carousel, and cards. It's almost fully responsive but not quite perfect.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Project #3</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/deathnote.html</li>
   <li>A complete "Web Dev Story" that adopts a Design Thinking approach to address a problem through a front-end website build. I really try to build upon my bootstrap skills for this project by building upon what I learned in my previous project as well as trying new things. Unlike my eCommerce site I was able to make this one fully responsive.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Project #3</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://54.144.132.105/KHome.html</li>
   <li>This was my Senior Project from Kean University. Our team of 4 decided to redesign Kean University's student portal. Each team member dedicated a redesign of a single page. The page I redesigned was the 'Other Services' page which use to look like this:

       Using a full tech stack of Javascript, CSS, HTML, AWS, and SQL we were able to implement a complete redesign overhall including implementing a dark mode, full responsive page to al devices, a back end that updated the students information like a class schedule or student transcript, and hosting it using Amazon Web Servers.
    </li>
    </ul>
