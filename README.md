# WebDevelopmentProjects
All three of these projects were made for my Kean University TECH3500 Web Client-Side Programming class

Evan Weinman
Project #1

    http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/evanweinman.html

    The first project we worked on was a personal website for ourselves. This was pre-bootstrap learning and the goal was to go for a sleak minimalistic design.

Project #2

    http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/eCommerce/ecommerce.html

    The second project was a front-end prototype of an E-commerce website. I introduce some bootstrap to give the website a very modern look this includes a navbar, carousel, and cards. It's almost fully responsive but not quite perfect.

Project #3

    http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/deathnote.html

   A complete "Web Dev Story" that adopts a Design Thinking approach to address a problem through a front-end website build. I really try to build upon my bootstrap skills for this project by building upon what I learned in my previous project as well as trying new things. Unlike my eCommerce site I was able to make this one fully responsive.
