# WebDevelopmentProjects
<b>All three of these projects were made for my Kean University TECH3500 Web Client-Side Programming class</b>

<h1>Evan Weinman</h1>
<h2>Project #1</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/evanweinman.html</li>
    <li>The first project we worked on was a personal website for ourselves. This was pre-bootstrap learning and the goal was to go for a sleak minimalistic design.</li>
   </ul>

<h2>Project #2</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/eCommerce/ecommerce.html</li>
    <li>The second project was a front-end prototype of an E-commerce website. I introduce some bootstrap to give the website a very modern look this includes a navbar, carousel, and cards. It's almost fully responsive but not quite perfect.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Project #3</h2>

<ul>
    <li>http://eve.kean.edu/~weinmane/portfolio/deathnote.html</li>
   <li>A complete "Web Dev Story" that adopts a Design Thinking approach to address a problem through a front-end website build. I really try to build upon my bootstrap skills for this project by building upon what I learned in my previous project as well as trying new things. Unlike my eCommerce site I was able to make this one fully responsive.</li>
    </ul>
